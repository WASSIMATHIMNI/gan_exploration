The dataset we’ll be using here is LeCunn’s MNIST dataset, consisting of about 60.000 black and white images of handwritten digits, 
each with size 28x28 pixels

The Discriminator network will take a flattened image as its input, and return the probability of it belonging to the real dataset,
or the synthetic dataset.

The Generative Network takes a latent variable vector as input, and returns a 784 valued vector, 
which corresponds to a flattened 28x28 image. The purpose of this network is to learn how to create 
undistinguishable images of hand-written digits, which is why its output is itself a new image.

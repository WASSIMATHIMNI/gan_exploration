# Generative Adversarial Network Exploration

Exploration of GANs in the context of ESDC/Government

Potential paths to explore (We will add other topics as we progress):

- Generation of fake documents/images to fool government processes in place (Proof of concept to understand the risks)
- Model Robustness (Better model training with noisy environment)
- Semi-supervised methods (Case: Good discriminator with a small sample of labeled data)
- Explore recent text generation solutions with GANs

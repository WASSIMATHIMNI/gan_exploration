# Generative Adversarial Network Exploration

Exploration of GANs in the context of ESDC/Government

Areas of interest:
- Integrity/Security (Fooling Processes)
- Model Enhancements (Robustness, bias removal, data augmentation, etc.)
- Generating Content (Summaries, styles, etc.)

Potential paths to explore (We will add other topics as we progress):

- Generation of fake documents/images to fool government processes in place (Proof of concept to understand the risks) [Carlos/Matt/Wassim]
- Model Robustness (Better model training with noisy environment)
- Semi-supervised methods (Case: Good discriminator with a small sample of labeled data)
- Explore recent text generation solutions with GANs
- Super-Resolution (SRGAN)
- Text to Image (StackGAN) (Amir)
- Image to Image (Pix2Pix) (Amir)
- Anomaly Detection (ANOGan) (Amir)
- RadialGAN (Leveraging multiple datasets to improve target-specific predictive models)
- Reinforcement Learning With GANS (Generate Realistic States)
- Mitigating Unwanted Bias with Adversarial Learning (Adversarial training to remove Bias from models)
